# Lazer Bracket Generator

This application contains a script that will automatically write a bracket.json file for your lazer tourney client. To get started just download this repository and open 'lazer_bracket_generator.exe'. 

Set in the appropriate settings for your tournament, scroll down and press "execute script".

Keep in mind the first qualifier lobby you input (top left) is used to determine the mappool, so make sure this lobby is conducted correctly with no players disconnecting mid play or other strange events.

Beside a bracket.json file there will also be a folder with extra data. These files are formattet to be copy pasted into your google sheets if you need

My projects are open source. If you are interrested in the backend of my work, you can see everything in the attached python file. Other wise you are very welcome to contact me on discord with any questions.
